# Fatigue strength testing machine

TDB:
- [ ] start button/tumbler;
- [ ] better/faster stop mechanism;
- [ ] PCB;
- [ ] bigger motor;
- [ ] better on-shaft fixation;

## Description

Machine for determining the fatigue strength of samples with different patterns (so-called "living hinge", which makes sample exert flexibility) produced using a laser machine.

Hardware:

- Amperka Iskra Neo (Leonardo);
- Amperka Motor Shield;
- Amperka Troyka Shield;
- Hall sensor (involved into counting cycles);
- Amperka Quad Display.

Features:
- autamatic cycle counting;
- automatic stop (altough with delay).

## Generating samples

Grasshopper definition was designed to make it easier to create different patterns:

## Testing sample

If you wait long enough - it breaks (either sample or machine).
